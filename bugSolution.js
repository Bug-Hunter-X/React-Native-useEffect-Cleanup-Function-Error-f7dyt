The solution involves adding a check to ensure the component is still mounted before executing any code in the cleanup function.  We'll use a ref to track the component's mounted state. 

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const mounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = someAsyncFunction().subscribe(data => {
      if (mounted.current) {
        setData(data);
      }
    });

    return () => {
      mounted.current = false; // Set mounted to false before cleanup
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    // ... JSX ...
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
By setting `mounted.current` to `false` before the cleanup function executes any actions, we prevent any further attempts to access variables in a potentially unmounted component.
