This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function tries to access a component variable that has already been unmounted.  The error message is often vague and difficult to track down, usually something like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')".

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncFunction().subscribe(data => {
    setData(data);
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw an error if component unmounts
  };
}, []);
```
